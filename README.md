# TerminaLibsCore
TerminaLibs but there's no .NET 6 SDK requirement

## If you use MacOS/Linux, this will NOT work, since it's a setup file published in .exe (CLR is funny)
### And I recommend you go check out the original repo.

This is still a bit buggy, since it's running .NET 4.7, so a few functions like the custom madlib are broken, but I'm working on it. 
Report any bugs in the ``Issues`` section please :) 

(some of the files may be called "TerminaLibsNET", since it was the original project name, but after some consideration I decided to change it)
